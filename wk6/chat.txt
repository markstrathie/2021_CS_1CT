12:01:58	 From Hermione Granger : hello!
12:02:02	 From Bilbo Baggins : good morning
12:02:03	 From Hercule Poirot : yo
12:02:03	 From Sherlock Holmes : hi
12:02:07	 From Princess Leia : heeyy
12:02:14	 From Indiana Jones : yo!
12:05:10	 From Peter Pan : Hey there!
12:06:11	 From Marge Simpson : @random I love the background:)
12:17:21	 From Hercule Poirot : farside is class
12:27:46	 From Hercule Poirot : looks great
12:27:56	 From Forrest Gump : comments are useful too
12:28:12	 From Marge Simpson : ^^agreed
12:28:22	 From Charlie Brown : So can we all edit the post from anyone and do we have to put our name in after we edited?
12:29:19	 From Forrest Gump : It keeps an edit history in the history tab Charlie. So you can edit the post from anyone with a record kept in history, or comment on anyone's post separately.
12:29:38	 From Charlie Brown : Thank you.
12:38:56	 From Mary Poppins : Is there a common format for naming? 
12:39:29	 From Marge Simpson : I know any name can b used for variables but is there any reason why f is the one usually used
12:39:41	 From Tony Stark : I got told at higher that the name of the variable should relate to what it's supposed to do in some way
12:39:58	 From Mary Poppins : So more a cultural thing than a set format ?
12:40:37	 From Snow White : I think f is used to refer to file.
12:40:45	 From Marge Simpson : kind of love the idea of writing a programme with deliberately misleading variable names
12:41:26	 From Mary Poppins : cypher programming Marge lol 
12:41:36	 From Buzz Lightyear : sneaky lecturers
12:41:38	 From Bo Peep : Tony, I think that is just so that it makes sense when you are trying to read it, or someone else is reading it.
12:41:38	 From Hercule Poirot : why can anyname be used in th foor loop again, I forget
12:42:01	 From Peter Pan : And it is useful to name files so that you in two years understand what you were meaning))
12:42:07	 From Jeremy Singer : @Marge you need to enter the obfuscated C competition ... https://www.ioccc.org/
12:42:13	 From Mary Poppins : because it can be anyname. Its literal you could call it potato loop if youwanted
12:42:53	 From Hercule Poirot : yeah I get that, my confusion is more why the name does not matter
12:43:15	 From Marge Simpson : that sounds fun ! never used c in my life but I'm
12:43:26	 From Marge Simpson : I'll just go with it
12:45:40	 From Doctor Who : should the single names file just include the single name people or the first name of everyone?
12:45:54	 From Indiana Jones : we're solving this with our teams tutorial group, right/
12:46:49	 From Buzz Lightyear : honestly im not sure if ive got the right group..
12:48:11	 From Dorothy Gale : Can you put the question up again please?
12:48:15	 From Buzz Lightyear : ^^
12:48:29	 From Buzz Lightyear : thank you :)
12:48:30	 From Quintin Cutts : Sorry - there it is nowâ€¦
12:48:36	 From Dorothy Gale : thank you!
12:50:18	 From Elizabeth Bennett : sorry could you put up the task for a second
12:50:44	 From Quintin Cutts : Hi Elizabeth - I think it is up - it's showing on my screen
12:50:49	 From Dorothy Gale : It's on the main screen
12:51:14	 From Quintin Cutts : Oh Sorry - you mean what to do - identify aspects of this task that are like others you've solved already - what other problems is it like?  Can you see reusable patterns...
12:51:20	 From Elizabeth Bennett : sorry the actual question as in "discuss in your teams..."
12:51:27	 From Elizabeth Bennett : ah okay]
12:51:29	 From Elizabeth Bennett : thanks
12:51:55	 From Buzz Lightyear : how long are we here for?
12:52:15	 From Quintin Cutts : Another minute or so
12:54:59	 From Indiana Jones : 3 variables for opening the file
12:55:05	 From Hercule Poirot : if/else
12:55:11	 From Indiana Jones : but we're writing data onto 2 files
12:55:18	 From Doctor Who : while loop
12:55:19	 From Forrest Gump : Q5 and Q7 had similar functions
12:55:26	 From Peter Pan : extract the data from names.txt
12:55:34	 From Hercule Poirot : split()
12:55:41	 From Peter Pan : slicing
12:55:44	 From Ada Lovelace : calculate number of items?
12:55:46	 From Indiana Jones : while file.readline() != ""
12:55:48	 From Hercule Poirot : if len = 1 
12:55:49	 From Charles Babbage : use if/else statements to check the conditions
12:55:53	 From Elizabeth Bennett : !="": in the while loop
12:55:57	 From Hercule Poirot : write in singlenames
12:56:00	 From Princess Leia : If/else, if there is one name then we put it in the single file
12:56:16	 From Peter Pan : yes
12:56:16	 From Alan Turing : figure out whether each line is 1 name, 2 names or more than 2 names
12:56:44	 From Princess Leia : Else if there are more values then we just keep the first and last
12:56:56	 From Elizabeth Bennett : separate the strings by spaces. ()
12:57:15	 From George Boole : reading unknown amount of lines from the file (for len of the file)
12:58:01	 From Bilbo Baggins : is using something like SplitData[(numberofitems - 1)] legal?
12:58:17	 From Lucy Pevensie : reate a list from ach line of the document
12:58:18	 From Hercule Poirot : if len() = 1
12:58:21	 From Indiana Jones :  we would use indexing
12:58:22	 From Charles Babbage : check the length of a list containing the names
12:58:22	 From Wendy Darling : length
12:58:28	 From Alan Turing : if, elif, else len(<names>) = 2
12:58:28	 From William Brown : Put them in a list separated by spaces and check how many items are in there
12:58:29	 From Ada Lovelace : if/else for numberOfItems depending on condition needed
12:58:30	 From Mary Poppins : [0]   [-1]  to select first and last name
12:58:33	 From Lucy Pevensie : a list
12:58:35	 From Hercule Poirot : split()
12:58:39	 From Miss Havisham : list
12:58:41	 From Wendy Darling : the list we create from each line
12:58:49	 From Nigel Molesworth : split
12:58:50	 From Queen Guinevere : we could convert the line to a list and just read the first and last items
12:58:50	 From Lucy Pevensie : split
12:58:51	 From George Boole : .split()
12:58:52	 From Hercule Poirot : split
12:58:53	 From Charlie Brown : split
12:58:53	 From Madame Bovary : split by space
12:58:54	 From Wendy Darling : split on each line
12:59:08	 From Tom Jones : .split()
12:59:11	 From Charlie Brown : Can we use another if under else: ?
12:59:16	 From Wendy Darling : and slice the end
12:59:18	 From Charlie Brown : or another else under else
12:59:39	 From Snow White : else if??
12:59:41	 From Nigel Molesworth : if, elseif, else
12:59:41	 From Lucy Pevensie : could you avoid it being three conditions?
13:00:13	 From Lucy Pevensie : by only checking if it's one name or more than one. And then if it's more than one name you just draw from the first and last item of a list
13:00:20	 From Lucy Pevensie : assuming we ar doing the list thing
13:00:22	 From Tony Stark : For the last part of the question about singleNames.txt, do we write everyone's first names into the file, or do we write only the ones that inputted 1 name into the original file?
13:00:48	 From Bilbo Baggins : what if the line is empty?
13:01:10	 From Wendy Darling : right while loop in the beginning?
13:01:33	 From Peter Pan : Is there a quiz on Friday?
13:03:55	 From Hercule Poirot : oldFile = open("names.txt")
13:03:58	 From Mary Poppins : will the quiz be on this topic or Jeremys?
